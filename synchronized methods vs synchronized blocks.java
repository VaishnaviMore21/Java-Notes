Sure! Here’s a detailed, interview-ready theory explanation of synchronized methods vs synchronized blocks in Java, including definitions, examples, use cases, pros/cons, and differences.
________________________________________
Synchronization in Java
Synchronization is a mechanism in Java used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads, preventing race conditions and data inconsistency.
When multiple threads try to read/write shared data concurrently, the program can produce unpredictable results. Java provides synchronized methods and synchronized blocks to handle this.
________________________________________
1. Synchronized Methods
Definition
•	A synchronized method is a method that locks the object (or class for static methods) when a thread is executing it.
•	Only one thread can execute a synchronized method of the same object at a time.
Syntax
public synchronized void methodName() {
    // critical section
}
Example
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : " + count);
    }

    public int getCount() { return count; }
}

public class TestSynchronizedMethod {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
                counter.increment();
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
Output Example:
Thread-1 : 1
Thread-2 : 2
Thread-1 : 3
Thread-2 : 4
...
Key Points
•	Locks the entire method.
•	Only one thread can execute it for a given object.
•	Simpler to implement.
•	Can be applied to instance methods or static methods.
Pros
1.	Easy to use.
2.	Guarantees thread safety for the entire method.
Cons
1.	Locks the whole method, even if only part of it needs synchronization → may reduce performance.
2.	Less flexible for complex scenarios.

2. Synchronized Blocks
Definition
•	A synchronized block allows you to lock a specific portion of code, rather than the entire method.
•	This improves performance by limiting the locked scope.
•	You can synchronize on any object.
Syntax
synchronized(object) {
    // critical section
}
Example 1: Simple Counter
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized(this) {  // synchronized block
            count++;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : " + count);
        }
    }
}
Example 2: Multiple Operations (Bank Account)
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 1000;

    public void performTransaction(int withdrawAmount, int depositAmount) {
        synchronized(this) { // multiple operations in same block
            if (balance >= withdrawAmount) {
                balance -= withdrawAmount;
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdrew " + withdrawAmount + ", Balance: " + balance);
            }
            balance += depositAmount;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " deposited " + depositAmount + ", Balance: " + balance);
        }
    }
}
Key Points
•	Only the critical section is synchronized.
•	Can synchronize on any object, not just this.
•	Allows fine-grained control, improving performance.
Pros
1.	Better performance than synchronized methods.
2.	Can lock specific objects or parts of code.
3.	Useful in complex scenarios where only part of the method is critical.
Cons
1.	Slightly more complex than synchronized methods.
2.	Incorrect synchronization may still lead to race conditions.
________________________________________
3. Differences Between Synchronized Method and Block
Feature	Synchronized Method	Synchronized Block
Lock Scope	Entire method	Specific block of code
Performance	Slower (locks whole method)	Faster (locks only critical section)
Flexibility	Less flexible	More flexible (can lock any object)
Syntax	public synchronized void method()	synchronized(object){ ... }
Use Case	Simple methods needing full synchronization	Complex methods with partial synchronization
Object Choice for Lock	this for instance methods, Class object for static	Any object reference
________________________________________
4. Best Practices (Interview Tips)
1.	Use synchronized blocks whenever possible – only lock critical sections, not entire methods.
2.	Use synchronized methods for simple cases where the whole method needs protection.
3.	Never lock on String literals – Strings are immutable and shared, which can cause deadlocks.
4.	Prefer concurrency utilities (ReentrantLock, AtomicInteger, ExecutorService) for more advanced synchronization.
5.	Always test multithreaded code carefully – race conditions may not appear in every run.
________________________________________
✅ Summary
•	Synchronized Method: Simple, locks whole method, may reduce performance.
•	Synchronized Block: Fine-grained locking, locks only critical section, better performance, more flexible.
•	Use Case: Choose method for simple cases and block for complex, performance-sensitive scenarios.

If you want, I can draw a clear diagram showing threads executing synchronized methods vs blocks with shared resources, which is very useful for interviews and visual explanations.
Do you want me to do that?
