Sure! Here's a **clean, concise table** comparing **Abstract Class vs Interface** in Java:

| Feature                  | Abstract Class                                                                  | Interface                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**           | A class that cannot be instantiated and can have abstract and concrete methods. | A reference type that defines method signatures (contract) which classes must implement. |
| **Methods**              | Can have both **abstract and concrete methods**.                                | All methods are **abstract by default** (`default` and `static` allowed in Java 8+).     |
| **Fields**               | Can have **instance variables** (mutable or final).                             | Fields are **`static` and `final`** by default (constants).                              |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | ❌ Not allowed (a class can extend only one class).                              | ✅ Allowed (a class can implement multiple interfaces).                                   |
| **Constructor**          | ✅ Can have constructors.                                                        | ❌ Cannot have constructors.                                                              |
| **Access Specifier**     | Methods and fields can have any access modifier.                                | Methods are **public by default**, fields are **public static final**.                   |
| **Object Creation**      | ❌ Cannot instantiate directly.                                                  | ❌ Cannot instantiate directly.                                                           |
| **When to Use**          | Use when classes share **common behavior and state**.                           | Use when classes share **common behavior only**, enforcing a contract.                   |
| **Polymorphism**         | Can be used via reference of abstract class.                                    | Can be used via reference of interface.                                                  |

If you want, I can also make a **visual diagram** showing **Abstract Class vs Interface** with methods and objects, which makes it **super easy to remember for interviews**.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
