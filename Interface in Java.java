Here’s a clear and structured explanation of Interfaces in Java based on what you provided, with some extra clarification and examples for better understanding:
________________________________________
Interface in Java
An interface in Java is similar to an abstract class, but with stricter rules:
•	All methods in an interface are abstract by default (they have no body unless you use default or static methods in Java 8+).
•	An interface cannot have instantiated objects directly.
•	A class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all its abstract methods.
________________________________________
Syntax to Declare an Interface
interface InterfaceName {
    void method1();  // abstract by default
    void method2();  // abstract by default
    // more methods...
}
________________________________________
Properties of an Interface
1.	All methods are abstract by default.
2.	Default access specifier for an interface is public.
3.	Cannot create objects of an interface.
4.	InterfaceName obj = new InterfaceName(); // ❌ Not allowed
5.	Reference of an interface can be created, often used for polymorphism.
6.	Fields are static and final by default (constants).
________________________________________
Implementing an Interface
To use an interface, a class implements it using the implements keyword. The class must implement all methods of the interface.
class ClassName implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    // implement all methods from Interface1 and Interface2
    public void method1() {
        System.out.println("Method1 implemented");
    }

    public void method2() {
        System.out.println("Method2 implemented");
    }
}
•	A class can implement multiple interfaces, which is a way Java achieves multiple inheritance.
•	If the class doesn’t implement all methods, it must be declared abstract.

All Syntaxes of Class Declaration in Java
1.	Simple class
class ClassName {
    // body
}
2.	Subclass extending a superclass
class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    // body
}
3.	Class implementing interfaces
class ClassName implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    // body
}
4.	Subclass extending a superclass and implementing interfaces
class SubClass extends SuperClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    // body
}

Key Differences Between Abstract Class and Interface
Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
Method Implementation	Can have both abstract & concrete	All methods abstract by default
Multiple Inheritance	Not allowed	Allowed via implementing multiple interfaces
Fields	Can have instance variables	Fields are static and final
Access Specifier	Any	public by default
Object Creation	Cannot create object	Cannot create object

If you want, I can also make a small Java code example showing a class implementing two interfaces to make it crystal clear how it works in practice.
Do you want me to do that?
