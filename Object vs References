Here’s a clear and interview-friendly explanation of the difference between object and reference in Java:
________________________________________
1. Object
Definition:
•	An object is a real entity in memory that represents an instance of a class.
•	It occupies memory and has state (fields/attributes) and behavior (methods).
Key Points:
1.	Created in heap memory using the new keyword.
2.	Represents the actual data of the instance.
3.	Can exist independently, but to access it, you usually need a reference.
Example:
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
}

public class TestObject {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student(); // 's' is a reference, new Student() is the object
        s.name = "Alice";
        s.age = 20;
    }
}
•	Here, new Student() creates the object in memory.
________________________________________
2. Reference
Definition:
•	A reference is a variable that points to an object in memory.
•	It does not hold the actual object, just the address/location of the object in the heap.
Key Points:
1.	Stored in stack memory.
2.	Can point to different objects over time.
3.	Can be null if it does not point to any object.
Example:
Student s1 = new Student(); // s1 is a reference pointing to a Student object
Student s2 = s1;            // s2 now points to the same object as s1
s1 = null;                   // original object still exists, but s1 no longer points to it

3. Key Differences Between Object and Reference
Feature	Object	Reference
Definition	Actual instance in memory	Variable that points to an object
Memory Location	Heap	Stack (stores address)
Represents	Real entity with state and behavior	Access path to the object
Creation	Using new keyword	Declared as a variable of class type
Can be null?	No (object exists in memory)	Yes (reference can point to null)
Usage	Performs operations / stores data	Accesses the object
Example	new Student()	Student s = new Student();
________________________________________
Summary
•	Object = Actual instance in memory.
•	Reference = Variable that points to the object.
•	Analogy: Think of a house (object) and its address (reference). You can have the address without the house being occupied, but the house is the actual entity.

If you want, I can also make a small diagram showing reference and object in memory, which is very helpful for interviews.
Do you want me to do that?
