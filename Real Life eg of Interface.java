Sure! Let’s take a real-life example to understand interfaces in Java.
________________________________________
Example Scenario: Payment System
•	In real life, there are different payment methods: Credit Card, PayPal, UPI, etc.
•	Every payment method should have a pay action, but the implementation differs.
•	This is a perfect use case for an interface, because we just define the action in the interface and let each payment method implement it differently.
________________________________________
Java Code Using Interface
// Define the interface
interface Payment {
    void pay(double amount);  // all payment methods must implement this
}

// Implementing Credit Card payment
class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

// Implementing PayPal payment
class PayPalPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

// Implementing UPI payment
class UpiPayment implements Payment {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using UPI.");
    }
}

// Test class
public class PaymentTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment1 = new CreditCardPayment();
        Payment payment2 = new PayPalPayment();
        Payment payment3 = new UpiPayment();

        payment1.pay(1000);  // Paid 1000 using Credit Card.
        payment2.pay(500);   // Paid 500 using PayPal.
        payment3.pay(250);   // Paid 250 using UPI.
    }
}
________________________________________
Explanation:
1.	Payment interface defines what every payment method should do (pay method).
2.	Each class (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, UpiPayment) implements the interface and defines its own logic.
3.	We can treat all payment types uniformly using the Payment reference — this is polymorphism in action.

Perfect! Let’s take a Notification System example — very practical in real-world apps.
________________________________________
Scenario: Notification System
•	In an application, you can send notifications via Email, SMS, or Push Notification.
•	Every notification must have a send action, but the implementation differs for each type.
•	Interface is perfect to define this common behavior.
________________________________________
Java Code Using Interface
// Define the interface
interface Notification {
    void send(String message);  // all notification types must implement this
}

// Implementing Email notification
class EmailNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending Email: " + message);
        // Real logic: connect to email server, send email
    }
}

// Implementing SMS notification
class SMSNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS: " + message);
        // Real logic: connect to SMS gateway, send SMS
    }
}

// Implementing Push notification
class PushNotification implements Notification {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending Push Notification: " + message);
        // Real logic: connect to push service, send notification
    }
}

// Test class
public class NotificationTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Notification n1 = new EmailNotification();
        Notification n2 = new SMSNotification();
        Notification n3 = new PushNotification();

        n1.send("Your order is confirmed!");
        n2.send("Your OTP is 123456.");
        n3.send("You have a new friend request.");
    }
}
________________________________________
Logic Behind Each Class
1.	Notification interface defines send(message) → all notification types must implement this method.
2.	EmailNotification class → sends message via email.
3.	SMSNotification class → sends message via SMS.
4.	PushNotification class → sends message via push notification.
5.	Polymorphism:
o	We can store any notification type in a Notification reference.
o	We call send() without worrying about the notification type.
________________________________________
✅ Key Takeaway:
•	The interface defines what to do (send notification).
•	Each class defines how to do it (Email, SMS, Push).
•	This makes the code flexible, reusable, and easy to extend.
________________________________________
If you want, I can draw a diagram showing the interface and three notification classes to visualize it clearly—it’s very helpful for interviews.
Do you want me to draw it?
